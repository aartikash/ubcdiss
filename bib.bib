	abstract="In this paper, we provide an approach to data-driven control for artificial pancreas systems by learning neural network models of human insulin-glucose physiology from available patient data and using a mixed integer optimization approach to control blood glucose levels in real-time using the inferred models. First, our approach learns neural networks to predict the future blood glucose values from given data on insulin infusion and their resulting effects on blood glucose levels. However, to provide guarantees on the resulting model, we use quantile regression to fit multiple neural networks that predict upper and lower quantiles of the future blood glucose levels, in addition to the mean.",

	abstract="Deep neural networks have emerged as a widely used and effective means for tackling complex, real-world problems. However, a major obstacle in applying them to safety-critical systems is the great difficulty in providing formal guarantees about their behavior. We present a novel, scalable, and efficient technique for verifying properties of deep neural networks (or providing counter-examples). The technique is based on the simplex method, extended to handle the non-convex Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, which is a crucial ingredient in many modern neural networks. The verification procedure tackles neural networks as a whole, without making any simplifying assumptions. We evaluated our technique on a prototype deep neural network implementation of the next-generation airborne collision avoidance system for unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu). Results show that our technique can successfully prove properties of networks that are an order of magnitude larger than the largest networks verified using existing methods.",

We illustrate our proposal in the context of surgery by considering the automatic execution of a simple action such as puncturing. To prove that a sequence of subtasks planned on preoperative data can successfully accomplish the surgical operation despite model uncertainties, we specify the problem by using hybrid automata. We express the requirements of interest as questions about reachability properties of the hybrid automaton model. Then, we compare the different performance of current state-of-the-art tools for reachability analysis of hybrid automata.",

	abstract={In this paper, one solution for an end-to-end deep neural network for autonomous driving is presented. The main objective of our work was to achieve autonomous driving with a light deep neural network suitable for deployment on embedded automotive platforms. There are several end-to-end deep neural networks used for autonomous driving, where the input to the machine learning algorithm are camera images and the output is the steering angle prediction, but those convolutional neural networks are significantly more complex than the network architecture we are proposing. The network architecture, computational complexity, and performance evaluation during autonomous driving using our network are compared with two other convolutional neural networks that we re-implemented with the aim to have an objective evaluation of the proposed network. The trained model of the proposed network is four times smaller than the PilotNet model and about 250 times smaller than AlexNet model. While complexity and size of the novel network are reduced in comparison to other models, which leads to lower latency and higher frame rate during inference, our network maintained the performance, achieving successful autonomous driving with similar efficiency compared to autonomous driving using two other models. Moreover, the proposed deep neural network downsized the needs for real-time inference hardware in terms of computational power, cost, and size.},
