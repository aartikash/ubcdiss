\chapter{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank the following:
My advisor, Karthik Pattabiraman, for allowing me to pursue my ideas and explore during my masters which was my original goal. I've learned a lot from him. 

Margo Seltzer for being a constant source of inspiration that helped me pursue my ideas fearlessly and enjoy research during my masters. Without her, this thesis would not have been possible. 

Syed Mubashir Iqbal for collaborating on this work and teaching me a bunch of stuff; working with Mubashir was one of the most fun experiences of my master's thesis because of the infinite all-nighters we pulled off to finish the experiments in ICICS 348. 

Mark Greenstreet, Alan Hu, Hassan Halawa and Puneet Mehrotra for patiently listening to my half-baked ideas in the initial stages of the work that eventually lead me to find my path. 

William Bowman for introducing me to the world of abstractions that helped me understand my work a little better.  

Members of the computer systems reading group and static analysis reading group for interesting discussions that might have directly or indirectly influenced my thinking. 

The multiple 'travel granting committees' from conferences that allowed me to
travel all around the world and have many interesting discussions with researchers which might have significantly influenced my thinking. 

Members of Dependable Systems and Systopia (formerly NSS) Lab for multiple fun hangouts. 

The library staff at UBC for always ordering the books I've asked for as soon as possible.

All my friends (y' all know who you are) for being there; listening to my constant bicker about life despite being in different timezones.   

Tom Lee Music store for letting me use their jam room for hours and hours every week since 2018. Surviving the journey without music would be impossible. 

Akshay Gopalakrishnan for ... everything. 

My ma and sister for being ok (or may be pretending to be ok) with my new life plan every other week, thus never holding me back.
