\chapter{Lay Summary}

Safety-critical cyber-physical systems designs have recently evolved from utilizing conventional control theory to utilizing deep neural networks for model building purposes. Researchers have conducted security analysis in deep neural networks, and safety-critical systems modeled using conventional control theory separately.  However, understanding the effects of using deep networks for modeling safety-critical systems has not been completely explored yet. 

Our work looks at the security effects of deep neural networks in three practical safety-critical systems: Artificial Pancreas System, and Aircraft control management systems (ACAS Xu and HCAS). We introduce a new category of attacks called Ripple attacks which are formalized using Mixed Integer Linear Programming. We use the formalism to synthesize the attacks in our three chosen systems in a feasible amount of time. 

%Basically three things are being done here
%1- new category of attacks
%2- formalised them
%3- showed them on three different systems
